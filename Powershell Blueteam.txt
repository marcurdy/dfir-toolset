Blueteam Powershell Recommendations

1) Upgrade the environment to Powershell v5 and remove prior versions where possible to add logging and restriction abilities.

2) Enable Powershell Logging
   Detection of PowerShell attack activity on your network begins with logging PowerShell activity. Enabling PowerShell logging
   requires PowerShell v3 and newer and PowerShell v4 adds some additional log detail (Windows 2012 R2 & Windows 8.1 with November
   2014 roll-up KB300850) useful for discovering and tracking attack activity.
   PowerShell logging can be enabled via Group Policy for PowerShell modules:
	  Microsoft.PowerShell.* – Log most of PowerShell’s core capability.
	  ActiveDirectory – Log Active Directory cmdlet use.
	  BITSfer – Logs use of BITS cmdlets.
	  CimCmdlets (2012R2/8.1) – Logs cmdlets that interface with CIM.
	  GroupPolicy– Log Group Policy cmdlet use.
	  Microsoft.WSMan.Management – Logs cmdlets that manage Web Services for Management (WS-Management) and Windows Remote Management (WinRM).
	  NetAdapter/NetConnection – Logs Network related cdmdlets.
	  PSScheduledJob/ScheduledTasks (PSv5) – Logs cmdlets to manage scheduled jobs.
	  ServerManager – Log Server Manager cmdlet use.
	  SmbShare – Log SMB sharing activity.
   PowerShell logging can also be configured for all PowerShell modules (“*”) useful if the attacker has imported custom modules

2a) Transcription
PowerShell now transcribes what it can of console commands that manipulate the console buffer directly and can 
now be enabled in hosts such as the PowerShell ISE.  
Create a directory to hold transcripts.  
Set permissions on the directory to prevent tampering. (I chose SDDL for the shortest code here.)  
Trim the transcript directory contents on an interval to avoid filling the drive (if local).  
To enable automatic transcription, enable the ‘Turn on PowerShell Transcription’ feature in Group Policy through Windows Components -> Administrative Templates -> Windows PowerShell. For automation, the configuration settings are:  
HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\Transcription  
EnableTranscripting, 1  
IncludeInvocationHeader,1  
OutputDirectory, [Path]  
  
2b) Script Block Logging
PowerShell v5 and KB 3000850 introduces deep script block logging. This exposes what is being run.
To enable automatic transcription, enable the ‘Turn on PowerShell Script Block Logging’ feature in Group Policy 
through Windows Components -> Administrative Templates -> Windows PowerShell.  If you select ‘Log script block invocation start / stop events’, PowerShell also logs start and stop events for every time a script block is invoked. This latter setting can generate an extremely high volume of events, so should be enabled with caution.  For automation, the configuration settings are stored under HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\ScriptBlockLogging.  
EnableScriptBlockLogging, 1  
EnableScriptBlockInvocationLogging, 1  
It may also be a good idea to increase the log size. The Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational log is 15MB by default.  
  
2c) Protected Event Logging 
Enable this to allow legitimate PS users to encrypt sensitive information that might be otherwise exposed in 
script block logging.

3) Constrained Powershell - Whitelisting

The strongest form of protection is when a system employs AppLocker in ‘Allow Mode’, where only specific known 
applications are allowed to run.  Known applications can restrict execution from script from a protected directory
or signed by the enterprise's trusted code signing certificate. In version 5, PowerShell reduces the script's 
functionality to “Constrained Mode” for both interactive input and user-authored scripts when it detects that 
PowerShell scripts have an ‘Allow Mode’ policy applied to them.  Before Powershell 5, the commands can be entered 
manually.  This doesn't stop execution from a manually installed and portable version of an earlier Powershell.

4) Detect Powershell generated EventId's within a SIEM or equivalent

Depending on OS version, it is contained within:
  Windows PowerShell.evtx
  Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational log
  Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Analytic.etl
  Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Operational.evtx
  Microsoft-Windows-WinRM/Analytic.etl

ID 6:     Creating WSMan Session                 ID 81:    Processing client request for operation CreateShell
ID 134:   Sending response for DeleteShell       ID 169:   User X authent success using NTLM
ID 400:   Engine Started                         ID 403:   Engine Stopped
ID 772:   WinRM request to target system         ID 1044:  WINRM response from a system
ID 4100:  Error Messages (PS 3.0 and higher)     ID 4103:  PS module logging
ID 4104:  Script block logging enabled           ID 4105:  Script block invocation logging start
ID 4106:  Script block invocation logging end    ID 4656:  handle to wsman\client keyID
ID 7937:  Executed cmdlets, scripts, or commands
ID 8005:  AppLocker permitted execution of PS    ID 8006:  AppLocker would have prevented PS exec 
ID 32850: Creating attributable remote session   ID 32867: Recv remoting frag of encoded payload  
ID 32868: Sent remoting frag of encoded payload  ID 40961: PowerShell console is starting up
ID 40962: PowerShell ready for user input
Field HostName == ConsoleHost is for a local session
Field HostName == ServerRemoteHost is for remote session

5) Blacklist known Powershell executables not maintained by IT

While attackers have tools to circumvent this, it helps prevent them from being installed and therefore makes 
finding a rogue PS instance one of more significant value.   

6) Monitoring the Powershell Operational log - Script block logging enabled

Many PowerShell attack tools can be detected by monitoring the above PowerShell event logs for indicators. 
They include the PowerSploit tools, but many other PowerShell attack tools use the same methods.

Obfuscation of commands include:
ToString, Reverse, Split, Replace, Concat, and the "-f" operator
FromBase64String or Base64
Look for a high count of characters used for obfuscation
  examples: "$' for variables, semicolon for multiple commands, plus for concat

-[E,EC,Enc,Encoded,EncodedCommand], -enc
-NoP, -NoProfile
-Nonl, -NonInteractive
-[W,Win,Window] Hidden, -WindowStyle Hidden
-[EP,Exec,Execution] Bypass, -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
